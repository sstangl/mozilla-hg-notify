  Receive Hg push notifications from Mozilla projects with gnome-shell.

OH NO: THIS PROGRAM POLLS. I AM SO SORRY

  This program really should be written to use the Mozilla Pulse
	(http://pulse.mozilla.org) event system. Unfortunately, as of this writing,
	the repository I actually want to watch does not push Pulse events, and
  mozillapulse (http://hg.mozilla.org/users/clegnitto_mozilla.com/mozillapulse/)
	is unable to receive events even from mozilla-central anyway.

	Thus, polling, at least until a better way exists.
	What could possibly go wrong?

USAGE

	Modify source to poke the repositories you care about.
	  The default repository is for the IonMonkey project.
  Be running gnome-shell.
	Run the program.
